# JD Interpreter Privacy Policy

JD Interpreter (“**we**,” “**our**,” or “**us**”) is a custom GPT that analyzes
job-description (JD) text to surface key information about the company,
product, and role (“**Service**”).  
We respect your privacy and limit data collection to the bare minimum needed
to provide this analysis.

---

## 1.  Information We Collect 📄

| Category | Examples | Source |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **Job-description text** | Title, responsibilities, requirements, company blurb | You paste it into the chat |
| **Session metadata** | Prompt text, analysis output, timestamps | Generated automatically |

We intentionally **do not collect** personal résumés, LinkedIn data,
payment info, or sensitive categories (e.g., health data, government IDs).

---

## 2.  How We Use Your Information ⚙️

* To extract and summarize company context, product details, and role scope  
* To display the analysis results back to you in the chat  
* To improve the accuracy of the Service in aggregate, de-identified form

We **never sell or share** your JD text with advertisers or data brokers.

---

## 3.  Data Storage & Retention 🔒

* Prompts and analysis results are encrypted in transit (HTTPS) and at rest.  
* Raw JD text is retained for **30 days** solely for troubleshooting, then deleted automatically.  
* Aggregate, anonymous analytics may be kept longer to improve the model.

---

## 4.  Third-Party Processing 🤝

The only third party involved is **OpenAI**, which hosts and processes
the prompts under its API terms.  
No other vendors receive your data.

---

## 5.  Your Choices 🛠️

* **Delete your data** – email **privacy@yourdomain.com**; we will erase
  all associated logs within 7 days.  
* Simply stop using the GPT to end further data collection.

## 6.  Cookies & Tracking 🍪

This GitHub-Pages site uses only GitHub’s
essential cookies to serve static content.  
We employ **no advertising or cross-site tracking** cookies.

---

## 7.  Children’s Privacy 👶

The Service is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly
process their data.  If you believe a child has provided JD text, contact us
and we will delete it.

---

## 8.  Changes to This Policy 📝

We may update this policy from time to time.  When we do:

1. We’ll update the **last_updated** date at the top, and  
2. Post a notice in the Service description if changes are material.
